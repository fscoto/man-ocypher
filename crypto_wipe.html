<code class="Fn" title="Fn">crypto_wipe</code>() securely erases sensitive data
  in memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sensitive data (such as cryptographic keys or secret plaintexts) should be
  erased from memory as early as possible, to minimise the window in which it
  can be leaked. Standard functions like memset and bzero are not safe to use,
  as the compiler may decide they have no effect and optimise them out.

The arguments are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd>&#x00A0;</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa" title="Fa">secret</var></dt>
  <dd>The buffer to erase.</dd>
  <dt>&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd>&#x00A0;</dd>
  <dt><var class="Fa" title="Fa">secret_size</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of bytes to erase from the buffer. Normally this is the size of
      the entire buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Monocypher will wipe its context structs when finalizing an operation such as
  signing or decrypting. When using direct interfaces like
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr" href="crypto_lock.html">crypto_lock(3monocypher)</a>,
  these context structs are invisible to you. They are exposed in incremental
  interfaces like
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr" href="crypto_blake2b_init.html">crypto_blake2b_init(3monocypher)</a>.
  The original key buffer does not get automatically wiped. When using
  incremental interfaces, you may want to wipe the original key buffers
  immediately after calling the respective init function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using <code class="Fn" title="Fn">crypto_wipe</code>() alone may not suffice for
  security. It is recommended to lock down relevant memory regions as well.
  Refer to <a class="Xr" title="Xr" href="intro.html">intro(3monocypher)</a> for
  instructions on how to lock down memory on common operating systems.
